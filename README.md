As of Now I have my fridge fully set up so that it maintains for the most part the temperature that I set it at. I Have been working on
my sql skills and hope to have the site deliver an email to the user informing him/her the high and low temperatures of the week
as well as the average temperature and the total time the beer has been fermenting.
